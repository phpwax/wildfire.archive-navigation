To use this plugin:

<?=partial("__archive_navigation", array('root'=>$top_level, 'active'=>$cms_content))?>

root is the top you want this nav to start at (so say the news section)

active is the current page (so a news story)

Basic styling is also included:

<?=css_bundle("wildfire.archive-navigation", array(), "wildfire.archive-navigation")?>

Along with js to make them slide up and down: 

<?=js_bundle("wildfire.archive-navigation", array(), "wildfire.archive-navigation")?>
